## What is an API?
- ##### An API (Application Programming Interface) is like a bridge that lets different software apps talk to each other and share data or services.
- #### üßæ Example:
  - ##### Imagine a waiter in a restaurant.
  - ##### You (user) give an order ‚Üí Waiter (API) sends it to the kitchen (server) ‚Üí brings food (response) back to you.

### üí° Why APIs are Useful:
- ##### Saves time for developers ‚Äî no need to build everything from scratch.
- ##### Helps apps share data (like weather, login info, etc.).
- ##### Used a lot in modern websites and apps.

### ‚öôÔ∏è How APIs Work:
- ##### 1. You send a request to an API.
- ##### 2. API asks the server.
- ##### 3. API asks the server.
- ##### 4. API gives you the result.

### Types of APIs:
- ##### `Web APIs`: Used over the internet, accessed via HTTP (e.g., weather or Google Maps APIs).

- ##### `Local APIs`: Work within a device or system (e.g., .NET).

- ##### `Program APIs`: Make remote systems seem local (e.g., SOAP).

### üåê Common API Types:
- #### `REST`:
  - ##### Simple, uses HTTP (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
  - ##### Flexible, uses HTTP (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to handle data.

- #### `SOAP`:
  - ##### Uses XML, more strict.
  - ##### Strict, uses XML for messaging.
  - ##### JSON-RPC / XML-RPC: Use JSON/XML to send data.

### API Testing
- ##### This Checks if an API works correctly (functionality, security, performance).
- ##### Tools: Postman, JMeter, SoapUI.

### Advantages:
- ##### Fast and efficient.
- ##### Connects apps for better user experiences.
- ##### Automates tasks



### Disadvantages:
- ##### Can be costly to build and maintain.
- ##### Security risks if not protected properly.
