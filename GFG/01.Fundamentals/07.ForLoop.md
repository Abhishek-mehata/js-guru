# JavaScript Loops

Loops are fundamental concepts in programming that allow us to execute a block of code repeatedly.
The types of loops are:

## For Loop

- ##### The `for loop` is one of the most commonly used loops in JavaScript.
- ##### It provides a concise way to iterate over a range of values and is often preferred over the `while loop` due to its compact syntax.

### Syntax

```js
for (Initialization; Condition; Increment / Decrement) {
  // Code to be executed in each iteration
}
```

- ##### `Initialization`

  - ##### This is executed once before the loop starts.
  - ##### It is typically used to declare and initialize a loop counter variable which can be used further in the Loop.

- ##### `Condition`

  - ##### This is evaluated before each iteration of the loop.
  - ##### If it condition becomes `true`, the loop body is executed. If condition becomes `false`, the loop terminates.

- ##### `Increment / Decrement`
  - ##### This is executed after each iteration of the loop.
  - ##### It is typically used to update the loop counter variable.

### Examples:

- #### Simple Counting

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(`Hello, i = ${i}`);
}
console.log("Loop finished!");
```

- ##### How it works:

```md
1. i = 0 (initialize counter to 0)

2. Check: i < 10? Yes â†’ execute code

3. Print "Hello, i = 0"

4. i++ (increment i to 1)

5. Repeat until i = 10 (condition becomes false)
```

- #### Alternative Approach:

```js
let i;
for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(`Hello, i = ${i}`);
}
```

#### Iterating Through String Characters

```js
// T
const myName = "Arjun Sarkar";
// Indexing in String starts from 0 to (n-1) where
//  n is the length of the string.
//  (i.e 'A' -> index 0 ,'B' -> index 1, ...)

console.log(myName[0]); // 'A'
console.log(myName[1]); // 'r'
console.log(myName[2]); // 'j'
console.log(myName[3]); // 'u'
console.log(myName[4]); // 'n'
console.log(myName[11]); // 'r' -> last character of the string -> length -1
```

```js
const myName = "Arjun";
const strLength = myName.length;

console.log(`String length: ${strLength}`);

for (let i = 0; i < strLength; i++) {
  console.log(`Character at index ${i}: ${myName[i]}`);
}
```

---

#### Working with Arrays

```js
const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "grape"];

for (let i = 0; i < fruits.length; i++) {
  console.log(`Fruit ${i + 1}: ${fruits[i]}`);
}
```

### Nested `For Loop`'s

- ##### Nested loops are loops inside other loops so called parent loop.
- ##### This is useful for iterating over multi-dimensional data structures, such as arrays of arrays or matrices.

### Examples

- #### Printing a multiplication table from 1 to 10

```js
/**
 * i x j = i * j
 * 1 x 1 = 1
 * 1 x 2 = 2
 * 1 x 3 = 3
 * 1 x 4 = 4
 * 1 x 5 = 5
 * 1 x 6 = 6
 * 1 x 7 = 7
 * 1 x 8 = 8
 * 1 x 9 = 9
 * 1 x 10 = 10
 *
 * -----------
 *
 * 2 x 1 = 2
 * 2 x 2 = 4
 * 2 x 3 = 6
 * ... so on until 10 x 10
 */

for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
  for (let j = 1; j <= 10; j++) {
    // console.log(`i = ${i} , j = ${j}`)
    let product = i * j;
    console.log(`${i} x ${j} = ${product}`);
  }

  console.log("\n");
}
```
