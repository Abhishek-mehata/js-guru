## Logical Operators

- ##### Logical operators are used to combine two or more conditions and return a boolean value (true or false).
- ##### Just like comparision opeators, logical operators also return boolean values.
- ##### Some of the Logical Operators are:
  - ##### AND `&&`
  - ##### OR `||`
  - ##### NOT `!`
  - ##### Nullish Coalescing `??`

---

### AND `&&` Operator

- ##### AND `&&` operator returns `true` only if all of the conditions are `true` otherwise it returns `false`

```js
const physics = 90;
const maths = 95;
const chemistry = 83;
const biology = 96;

// if marks in all physics, maths and chemistry are greater than 85 then only one is eligible for engineering
if (physics > 85 && maths > 85 && chemistry > 85) {
  console.log("You are eligible for IIT....");
} else {
  console.log("Sorry you are not eligible for IIT....");
}
```

### OR `||` Operator

- ##### OR `||` operator returns true if at least one of the conditions is true.

```js
// Check eligibility for IIT based on subject marks

// Assume these are the marks (you can change these values)
let physics = 85;
let maths = 92;
let chemistry = 88;

// Condition: If marks in any one subject is greater than 90
if (physics > 90 || maths > 90 || chemistry > 90) {
  // At least one subject has marks greater than 90
  console.log("You are eligible for IIT....");
} else {
  // None of the subjects have marks greater than 90
  console.log("Sorry you are not eligible for IIT....");
}
```

### NOT `!` Operator

- ##### The NOT operator reverses the Boolean value of the operand.
- ##### If the operand is `true`, it returns `false`, and if the operand is `false`, it returns `true`.

```js
// Boolean variable indicating student's eligibility status
const isStudentEligible = false;

// Check if the student is NOT eligible
if (!isStudentEligible) {
  // If isStudentEligible is false, !false becomes true, so this block runs
  console.log("You are not eligible.");
} else {
  // If isStudentEligible is true, !true becomes false, so this block runs instead
  console.log("You are eligible.");
}
```
