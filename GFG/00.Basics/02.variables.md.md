### What is a Variable ?

- ##### A variable is a named placeholder that holds data or information.
- ##### Think of variables as containers that hold different types of data, such as text, numbers, or even more complex structures.

### Why use Variables?

- ##### In an e-commerce app, JavaScript uses variables to store product details when adding items to a wishlist or cart.
- ##### This makes it easy to access and update the data later.

## How to Create Variables

- ##### There are three main ways to declare variables in JavaScript: `var`, `let`, and `const`.
- ##### Each has its own use case and scope rules.

- ### Declaring Variables with `var`
  - ##### The `var` keyword is used to declare a variable.

```js
var message; // Creating Variable or Variable Decleration

message = "Hello Coders of Nepal"; // Assigning a value to variable or Variable Initialization
console.log(message);
```

- ### Declaring Variables with `let`
  - ##### The `let` keyword is a more modern way to declare variables and is generally preferred over `var` due to its block-scoping feature.

```js
let text; //creating variable or declaring variable

text = "JavaScript is OP"; //Assigning a value to a variable or initialization
console.log(text);
//............................
let myName = "Abhishek Mehata"; //Variable Decleration and Initialization
console.log(myName);
```

- ### Declaring Variables with const
- ##### The `const` keyword is used to declare variables that are meant to be constants, meaning their values should not change once assigned.

```js
const number = 12; //variable with const must be declared and initialized at once and not changed

console.log(number);

//With const, you must assign a value at the time of declaration, and this value cannot be changed later in your code.
```

### Variable Assignment and Re-assignment

- ##### Variables declared with `var` and `let` can be reassigned new values, while variables declared with `const` cannot.

```js
var message;
message = "Hello Coders of Nepal";

message = "My name is Abhishek";
console.log(message); // My name is Abhishek

//..........................................

let text = "Java is OP";

text = "JavaScript is OP";
console.log(text); // JavaScript is OP

//..........................................

const number = 10;
number = 20; // Error: Assignment to constant variable.
console.log(number);
```
