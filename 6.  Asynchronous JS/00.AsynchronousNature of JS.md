## Synchronous Naure of JS
- ##### In this nature of JS codes are executed line by line.
```js
console.log("Rohan is a hecker");
console.log("Abhi is a hacker");
```
#### output:
```
Rohan is a hecker
Abhi is a hacker
```

## Asynchronous Nature of JS
- ##### When JS gets a function which is asynchronous in nature. So it avoid for later.
  
```js
console.log("Hello world")


// setTimeout is a asyncronous function that takes two arguments: (a function to execute) and (a delay in milliseconds)
// The function will be executed after the specified delay/time and till then the rest of the code will be executed.
// This is how asynchronous code works in JS.
setTimeout(() => {
   console.log("I am inside the setTimeout function");;
}, 2000);

console.log("The end of the script");
```

#### Output:
```
Hello world
The end of the script
I am inside the setTimeout function
```
