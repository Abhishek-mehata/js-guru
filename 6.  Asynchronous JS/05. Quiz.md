What is the purpose of the setTimeout function?

A
Executes a function repeatedly at fixed intervals

B
Executes a function once after a delay

C
Executes a function immediately

D
Cancels a delayed function

Ans: B - The setTimeout function schedules a one-time execution of a function after a specified delay in milliseconds.

Question 2

What does the then() method of a Promise do?

A
Handles rejected promises

B
Cancels an unresolved promise

C
Converts a callback to a promise

D
Handles fulfilled promises

Ans: D - The then() method executes the provided callback when a Promise is resolved (fulfilled).

---

Question 3

Which method allows handling errors in promises?

A
catch()

B
then()

C
resolve()

D
finally()


Ans: A - The catch() method handles rejected promises and executes a callback with the rejection reason.

---

Question 4

What does async do when used with a function?

A
Makes the function synchronous

B
Automatically wraps the function's return value in a promise

C
Stops the execution of the function

D
Immediately executes the function

Ans: B - Declaring a function as async ensures it always returns a promise, even if the returned value is not explicitly a promise.

---
Question 5

What is the purpose of the await keyword?

A
Delays code execution indefinitely

B
Converts a promise into a callback

C
Pauses execution of an async function until a promise resolves

D
Handles rejected promises

Ans: C - The await keyword waits for the promise to resolve and then returns its value within an async function.

---
Question 6

What is the difference between setTimeout and setInterval?

A
setTimeout runs once, while setInterval executes repeatedly at intervals

B
setTimeout executes repeatedly, while setInterval runs once

C
Both execute functions immediately

D
Both are used for canceling asynchronous tasks

Ans: A - setTimeout delays a single execution, whereas setInterval repeats execution at a specified interval.

---
Question 7

What is the event loop's role in JavaScript?

A
To execute synchronous code

B
To prioritize promises over callbacks

C
To manage and execute asynchronous operations in the call stack

D
To handle HTTP requests

Ans: C - The event loop continuously checks the call stack and callback queue to manage asynchronous tasks.

---
Question 8

Which queue has a higher priority in the JavaScript event loop?

A
Callback queue

B
Timer queue

C
Render queue

D
Microtask queue

Ans: D - The microtask queue (e.g., Promise.then) has a higher priority than the callback queue (e.g., setTimeout).

---
Question 9

What is the output of the following code?

```js
console.log("A");
setTimeout(() => 
	console.log("B"), 0);
Promise.resolve().then(() => 
	console.log("C"));
console.log("D");
```

[A]
A, B, C, D

[B]
A, D, B, C

[C]
A, D, C, B

[D]
B, C, A, D


Ans: C - Synchronous tasks (A and D) execute first, then microtasks (C), followed by macrotasks (B from setTimeout).

---



Question 10

What is the purpose of Promise.finally()?

A
Executes only when a promise is fulfilled

B
Executes only when a promise is rejected

C
Cancels unresolved promises

D
Executes after a promise is settled, regardless of its state

Ans: D - The finally() method runs cleanup or final logic after a promise is either resolved or rejected.
