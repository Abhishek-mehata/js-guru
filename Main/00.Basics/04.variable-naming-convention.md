##### variable name should always describe the type of data stored in it

### Rules for writing a variable in JS
- ##### A variable name should not contain white space.
- ##### A variable name should not start with a number.
- ##### A variable name can consist of letters (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers, the dollar sign (`$`), and the underscore (`_`).
- ##### A variable name should not have any special character except $ and _ dollar and undersore.

```js
let $="Abhi";
console.log($)

let _="Chanam"
console.log(_)
```


```js
//variable naming:
let username;
let age;
let _isValid;
let $price;
let number1;
let number_2;
```

### Variable naming convention


```js
// ‚úÖ GOOD variable names (easy to read and understand)

// This stores a person's name
let userName = "Abhishek";

// This stores the total amount of money
let totalAmount = 1500;

// This tells if the user is logged in or not (true/false)
let isLoggedIn = true;

// This stores how old the user is
let userAge = 18;

// This stores the user's email
let emailAddress = "user@example.com";

// A constant value that never changes (written in capital letters)
const MAX_USERS = 100;

// This is an array (list) of users
let users = ["Ram", "Shyam", "Hari"];

```


```js
// ‚ùå BAD variable names (hard to read or confusing)

// This name is too short and not meaningful
let x = "Abhishek";

// This name uses capital letters in a confusing way
let Total_Amount = 1500;

// This is hard to read and not proper camelCase
let IsLOGGEDIN = true;

// This name is not clear (what is data?)
let data = 18;

// ‚ùå This is a reserved word in JS (cannot be used as a variable name)
// let class = "Science";

// ‚ùå Underscores like this are not common in JS variable names
let user_name = "Abhishek";
```

- ##### Use camelCase ‚Üí `userName`, `totalAmount`
- ##### Use clear names ‚Üí `userAge`, not `x`
- ##### Don‚Äôt use capital letters in the middle unless needed
- ##### Don‚Äôt use short, meaningless names like `a`, `x`, `temp`
- ##### Don‚Äôt use JS keywords like `class`, `let`, `function` as variable names
