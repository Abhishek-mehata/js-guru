## Difference Between `let` , `var` and `const`

- ##### `let` and `const` are block-scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the block they are defined.
- ##### `var` is function-scoped, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
- ##### `const` ensures that variables cannot be reassigned, which helps prevent accidental changes to important values.

- #### Difference on variable Re-decleration

```js
// Re-decleration using var
var message = "Hello";
var message = "Hi";
var message = "Bye";
console.log(message); // Output: Bye

// Re-decleration using let
let msg = "Hello";
let msg = "Hiii";
console.log(msg); // Output: SyntaxError: Identifier 'msg' has already been declared
// Cannot redeclare block-scoped variable and variable declared with let is block-scoped variable


// Re-decleration using const
const Message = "Hello";
const Message = "Hi";
console.log(Message); //SyntaxError: Identifier 'Message' has already been declared
// Cannot redeclare block-scoped variable and variable declared with const is block-scoped variable
```

- ##### Re-decleration is only possible with `var` but not `let` and `const`
- ##### Re-assignment is only possible with `var` and `let` but not `const`

---

- ##### Contemporarily we never use `var` these days becoz we use let and const due to development and advancement in JS.
- ##### We donot use `var` becoz it provides Re-decleration of same variable which is not good for developers.
