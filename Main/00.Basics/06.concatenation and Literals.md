### String Concatenation

- ##### String concatenation is the process of joining two or more strings together using the `+` operator.

```js
let userName = "Prakash";
let age = 99;

let message = "My name is " + userName + " and I am " + age + " years old";
console.log(message); // My name is Prakash and I am 99 years old.
```

### Template Literals

- ##### Template literals provide a more readable and convenient way to include variables in strings.
- ##### Template Literals are enclosed by backtick ( \` ) allowing `${}` to attach variables and values.
- ##### It improves the readability of code than the concatenation approach.

```js
let userName = "Prakash";
let age = 99;

let text = `My name is ${userName} and I am ${age} years old`;
console.log(text); // My name is Prakash and I am 99 years old.
```

- ##### There is one more benifit of `Template Literals` that You can write multiple lines of text in it.
```js
let userName = "Prakash"
let age = 99
let multipleLineText = `My name is ${userName} and 
I am ${age} years old.
I Love to Code,
I Love to eat,
I Love to Play`

console.log(multipleLineText)
// Output
// My name is Prakash and 
// I am 99 years old.
// I Love to Code,
// I Love to eat,
// I Love to Play
```
