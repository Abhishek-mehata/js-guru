### Comparision Operators

- ##### In JavaScript, comparison operators are used to compare two values, returning a Boolean value (true or false).

#### Basic Comparision Operators

- ##### Basic comparison operators compare two values and return a Boolean based on the condition being met.
- ##### Some of them are:
  - Greater Than `>`
  - Less Than `<`
  - Greater Than or Equal `>=`
  - Less Than or Equal `<=`

```js
// checks if 50 is greator than 30 and return boolean value
console.log(50 > 30); // true

// checks if 50 is less than 30 and return boolean value
console.log(50 < 30); // false

// 30 >= 30 is true because 30 is equal to 30.
console.log(30 >= 30); // true

// 50 <= 40 is false because 50 is not less than equal to 40.
console.log(50 <= 40); //false

// 50 == 40 is false because 50 is not equal to 40.
console.log(50 == 40); // false
```

### Comparison of Strings

- ##### In JavaScript, strings are compared based on their ASCII (Unicode) values.

```js
console.log("apple" > "banana"); // false

// It will compare each characters of the string.
// JavaScript compares strings based on **lexicographical order** (dictionary order),
// which means it compares character by character using their **Unicode (ASCII-like) values**.

// Step-by-step comparison:
// "apple" vs "banana"
// 'a' is compared with 'b'

// Unicode value of 'a' = 97
// Unicode value of 'b' = 98

// Since 97 < 98, "apple" is considered smaller than "banana"

// So it returns false, and the rest of the characters ('p', 'p', 'l', 'e') are not compared,
// because the result is already determined at the first character.
```

---

```js
console.log("glowing" > "glow"); // true

// Explanation:
// JavaScript compares strings character by character from left to right.

// Compare first characters: 'g' and 'g'
// 'g' === 'g', so move to next character.

// Compare second characters: 'l' and 'l'
// 'l' === 'l', so move to next character.

// --------------------------------------------------------------
// | Compare 'l' and 'l':                                       |
// | 'l' > 'l' is false,                                        |
// | but 'l' === 'l' is true,                                   |
// | so move to next character to decide overall comparison.    |
// --------------------------------------------------------------

// Compare third characters: 'o' and 'o'
// 'o' === 'o', so move to next character.

// Compare fourth characters: 'w' and 'w'
// 'w' === 'w', so move to next character.

// Now, "glow" has no more characters left (end of string).
// But "glowing" has remaining characters: 'i', 'n', 'g'.

// Since all characters matched so far and "glowing" is longer,
// JavaScript treats the longer string as greater.

// Therefore, "glowing" > "glow" evaluates to true.
```

---

```js
console.log("2" > 1); // ("2" > 1) ... (2 > 1) ... true
// comparision operaor( > ) here converts "2" into number datatype 2 and compare with 1
```

---

```js
console.log("01" == 1); // true
// it will convert "01" into a number which is 1 only and then compares with 1
```

### Strict Equality `===` vs Loose Equality `==`

- ##### `==` checks two value of are equal or not.
- ##### `===` checks both data types and value

```js
console.log("01" === 1); // false
console.log("01" === 1); // true
```

### Comparision operators between `null` and `undefined`

```js
console.log(null == undefined); // true
// undefined is basically value assigned to a variable when no value is assigned to that variable.
// null basically means nothing

console.log(null === undefined); // false
```

### Null in Mathematical Comparisons

- ##### null has unique behavior when used in mathematical comparisons (such as <, >, <=, >=).
- ##### In these comparisons, null is treated as 0.

```js
console.log(null > 0); //false
// // whenever you compare null with any number null is converted into zero but  (0 > 0) can't be possible

console.log(null < 1); //true

console.log(null >= 0); //true
```

```js
console.log(null == 0); // false
// here null is null only
// when you are checking for equality null is not converted into 0
```

---

---

### `undefined` in Mathematical expression

```js
console.log(undefined > "0"); // false
console.log(undefined > 0); // false
// undefined comparing to any number or string gives false except null

console.log(undefined >= 10); // false
```
