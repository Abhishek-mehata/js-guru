## While Loop

A while loop executes a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true. The condition is checked before each iteration.
The loop continues until the condition becomes false.

- ### Syntax

```js
while (condition) {
  // loop body
  // increment/decrement section
}
```

- ### Examples:

```js
// This loop will print numbers from 0 to 9

let i = 0; // loop counter variable initialization

while (i < 10) {
  // Ôø™ loop condition

  console.log(i); // Executable code for loop body

  i++; // Update counter (IMPORTANT!)
}

console.log("Execution Done!");
```

## Do-While Loop

A do-while loop executes a block of code at least once, then continues to execute as long as a specified condition is true. The condition is checked after each iteration.

In do while loop,the body of the loop is executed initially, and then the condition is checked.

- ### Syntax:

```js
do {
  // loop body
  // increment/decrement section
} while (condition); // condition section
```

- ### Examples:

```js
let i = 0;
do {
  console.log(i); // This will execute once
  i++;
} while (i > 10); // Condition is false, but loop ran once
```

```js
let i = 0;
do {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 5);
```

### Exercise

Create a program that asks the user to enter a number less than 50.If they enter a number greater than or equal to 50, keep asking until they provide a valid number which is less than 50.

```js
let readLineSync = require("readline-sync");

// let number = Number(readLineSync.question("Enter a number less than 50: "));

let number = 51; // Initializing number to a value greater than 50 to enter the loop

while (number >= 50) {
  number = Number(readLineSync.question("Enter a number less than 50: "));

  // says user to Re-enter the number which is less than 50
  if (number >= 50) {
    console.log("That number is too big! Try again.");
  }
}

console.log("Number is accepted!!! ");
```
