## JavaScript Engines

JavaScript engines are specialized programs responsible for interpreting and executing JavaScript code. They are embedded in environments like web browsers or Node.js. The two most prominent JavaScript engines are:

- **V8**: Used in Google Chrome and Node.js, known for its high performance and Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation.
- **SpiderMonkey**: Used in Mozilla Firefox, designed for flexibility and compatibility.

These engines follow a structured process to convert JavaScript source code into executable machine code, ensuring efficient execution.

## How JavaScript Engines Work

JavaScript engines process code in three main stages:

1. **Parsing**:
   - The engine reads the JavaScript source code and converts it into an **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**, a hierarchical representation of the code's structure.
   - This step ensures the engine understands the syntax and structure of the code.

2. **Compilation**:
   - The AST is translated into **bytecode** or **machine code** using **Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation**.
   - JIT compilation optimizes performance by compiling frequently executed code segments during runtime, balancing speed and efficiency.

3. **Execution**:
   - The bytecode or machine code is executed line by line, producing the desired output or behavior as defined by the JavaScript code.

### Example
Consider the following code:

```javascript
function calculateSum(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

let result = calculateSum(3, 4);
console.log(result); // Output: 7
```

- **Parsing**: The engine parses the `calculateSum` function and the rest of the code into an AST.
- **Compilation**: The AST is compiled into bytecode or machine code using JIT compilation.
- **Execution**: The engine executes the code, invoking `calculateSum(3, 4)` and logging `7` to the console.

## Execution Context in JavaScript

An **Execution Context** is an environment created by the JavaScript engine to manage the execution of JavaScript code. It is where memory allocation and code execution occur. When a browser encounters JavaScript code, the JavaScript engine (e.g., V8 or SpiderMonkey) is activated, and it creates an execution context to handle the code.

### Key Points
- The execution context is provided by the JavaScript engine and exists within the broader of browser environment.
- It is responsible for:
  - Allocating memory for variables and functions.
  - Executing the code line by line.
- Every JavaScript program, whether in a browser or Node.js, runs within an execution context.

## Types of Execution Contexts

There are two primary types of execution contexts in JavaScript:

1. **Global Execution Context (GEC)**:
   - Created when the JavaScript engine starts executing a JavaScript file.
   - There is only one GEC per JavaScript file (often referred to as the "bundle file" in projects like React, where multiple JavaScript files are compiled into a single file by tools like Webpack).
   - The GEC manages global variables, functions, and the global `this` value.

2. **Functional Execution Context (FEC)**:
   - Created whenever a function is invoked.
   - Multiple FECs can exist within a single JavaScript file, corresponding to the number of function calls.
   - Each FEC manages its own variables, arguments, and `this` value specific to the function.

### Example
In a single JavaScript file, the GEC is created when the file is loaded. If the code contains function calls, a new FEC is created for each function invocation.

## Components of an Execution Context

An execution context consists of three main components:

1. **Variable Object / Arguments Object**:
   - Stores variable declarations (e.g., `var`, `let`, `const`) and function declarations.
   - In an FEC, it also includes the **arguments object**, which contains the parameters passed to the function.

2. **Environment for Scope and Scope Chain**:
   - Manages the scope of variables and functions, determining which variables are accessible.
   - Maintains the **scope chain**, a list of all enclosing scopes that the current execution context can access (used for variable lookup).

3. **this Keyword**:
   - Sets the value of the `this` keyword, which refers to the object that owns the current execution context.
   - In the GEC, `this` typically refers to the global object (e.g., `window` in browsers).
   - In an FEC, `this` depends on how the function is called (e.g., as a method, standalone, or with `call`/`apply`).

## Phases of Execution Context Creation

The creation of an execution context occurs in two distinct phases:

1. **Creation Phase**:
   - The JavaScript engine scans the code to identify all variable and function declarations.
   - Variables declared with `var` are hoisted and initialized to `undefined`.
   - Function declarations are fully hoisted, meaning the entire function is stored in memory.
   - The engine creates a **Variable Environment** (also called the memory component), which stores variables and functions as key-value pairs in the **Variable Object**.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     var x = 10;

     function total(a, b) {
         return a + b;
     }
     ```
     In the creation phase, the Variable Object is populated as:
     ```
     {
         x: undefined, // Initialized later to 10 during execution
         total: function(a, b) { return a + b; }
     }
     ```

2. **Execution Phase**:
   - The engine executes the code line by line, creating a **Thread of Execution** (also called the code component).
   - Variables are assigned their values, and function calls are executed.
   - JavaScript is a **single-threaded, synchronous** language, meaning it executes one line of code at a time in a specific order.

### Visual Representation
```
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Creation Phase / Variable Environment                           | Threads of Execution (Execution Phase)
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| x: undefined (var x = 10)                                      | 1. Assign x = 10
| total: function(a, b) { return a + b; }                        | 2. Execute function calls or other statements
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

## Example: Execution Context in Action

Consider the following code:

```javascript
var x = 10;

function total(a, b) {
    var y = 5;
    return a + b + y;
}

let result = total(3, 4);
console.log(result); // Output: 12
```

### Creation Phase (GEC)
- The GEC is created when the script starts.
- Variable Object:
  ```
  {
      x: undefined, // Later assigned 10
      total: function(a, b) { ... },
      result: undefined // Later assigned the result of total(3, 4)
  }
  ```
- Scope chain and `this` are set (e.g., `this` points to the global object).

### Execution Phase (GEC)
- `x` is assigned `10`.
- The `total` function is invoked, creating an FEC.

### Creation Phase (FEC for `total`)
- Variable Object:
  ```
  {
      arguments: { a: 3, b: 4 },
      y: undefined // Later assigned 5
  }
  ```
- Scope chain includes the FEC and GEC (for accessing `x` if needed).
- `this` is set based on how `total` is called.

### Execution Phase (FEC)
- `y` is assigned `5`.
- The expression `a + b + y` (3 + 4 + 5) is evaluated, returning `12`.
- The FEC is destroyed after the function returns.

### Back to GEC
- `result` is assigned `12`.
- `console.log(result)` outputs `12`.

## JavaScript’s Synchronous and Asynchronous Nature

- **Synchronous Nature**:
  - JavaScript is inherently **single-threaded and synchronous**, meaning it executes one line of code at a time in a predictable order.
  - The execution phase processes code sequentially, ensuring deterministic behavior.

- **Asynchronous Behavior**:
  - JavaScript can exhibit **asynchronous behavior** through mechanisms like callbacks, promises, and `async/await`.
  - Asynchronous operations (e.g., timers, network requests) are handled by the browser’s Web APIs (e.g., `setTimeout`, `fetch`), which offload tasks and notify the JavaScript engine via the **event loop** when they are complete.
  - This allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations, making it suitable for tasks like fetching data or handling user interactions.
<!-- 
### Example of Asynchronous Code
```javascript
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Inside setTimeout");
}, 1000);

console.log("End");
```
**Output**:
```
Start
End
Inside setTimeout
```
- The `setTimeout` callback is executed asynchronously after 1000ms, while the synchronous code (`console.log`) runs immediately.

## Conclusion

Understanding the **Execution Context** is crucial for mastering JavaScript’s behavior. The JavaScript engine creates a structured environment to manage memory allocation and code execution through the **Global Execution Context** and **Functional Execution Contexts**. By breaking down the process into the **Creation Phase** (memory allocation) and **Execution Phase** (code execution), developers can better predict how their code will behave. Additionally, JavaScript’s ability to handle both synchronous and asynchronous operations makes it a versatile language for modern web development.
